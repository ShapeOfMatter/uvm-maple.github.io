This August, [Kaleigh Clary](https://cs.umass.edu/~kclary) will present her work, [Stick it to the Man: Correcting for Non-Cooperative Behavior of Subjects in Experiments on Social Networks](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22summer_clary.pdf) at [USENIX Security](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22). One of the things I really like about this work is the focus on analysis and implications of non-cooporative actors in network experiments.

# Why this matters
I tend to approach the world from the "PL perspective.
